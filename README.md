Repro for https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/163627

Running the app will throw this Error message

```
The placeholder, count, has its "type" resource attribute set to the "null" type in locale "de", but it
is "num" in the template placeholder. For compatibility with template placeholder, change the "type"
attribute to "num".
```
